              <p>Vocational education or Vocational Education and Training (VET), also called Career and Technical Education (CTE), prepares learners for jobs that are based in manual or practical activities, traditionally non-academic and totally related to a specific trade, occupation or vocation, hence the term, in which the learner participates. It is sometimes referred to as technical education, as the learner directly develops expertise in a particular group of techniques or technology.</p>

              <p>On-the-job training (OJT) is a practical approach to acquiring new competencies and skills needed for a job in a real, or close to real, working environment.

                It is often used to learn how to use particular tools or equipment in a live-work practice, simulated, or training environment<br>
                
                Rather than showing employees presentations or giving them worksheets, they learn about the job by doing it. This training happens at the workplace, with guidance from a supervisor, manager, or another knowledgeable employee.<br>
                
                New employees that undergo on-the-job training get a firsthand look at all the work procedures they can expect to encounter. They learn workplace expectations, equipment operation, and any other skill they need to complete their job successfully.<br>
                
                On-the-job training may take anywhere from days to weeks or longer, depending on the tasks the job requires. Often, new employees start by shadowing other employees and then move onto completing these tasks with supervision.<br></p>

              <p>Becoming a career and technical education teacher usually involves earning a bachelor’s degree in a teachable career field, followed by earning state certification or licensing for those teaching in public K-12 schools. Many schools offer bachelor’s degrees in career and technical education to help future educators prepare for vocational teaching careers. Prospective educators should choose a program approved by its state board of education for the preparation of teachers, as this is a common requirement for teacher licensure. In addition to education, another common requirement for vocational teachers is to have experience in the field. Since they are teaching students to become proficient in practical career skills, they should ideally have extensive experience in performing those skills themselves. The most common pathway to becoming a vocational teacher in a public K-12 school is as follows:<br>

               1- Earn a bachelor’s degree in the subject you wish to teach or in career and technical education.<br>
               2- If your area of expertise requires a state license to practice, as is the case in fields like nursing or accounting, apply for the necessary license or credential.<br>
               3- Accumulate several (ideally, five) years of experience working in a teachable vocational field, if required.<br>
               4-  Complete a student teaching internship in a career tech classroom if certification is required.<br>
               5-  Take your state’s required exams for teachers.<br>
               6- Apply for your vocational teaching license.<br>
               7- Begin applying for open career and technical education jobs.<br>
              8- Many states also offer specialized alternative teacher certification pathways for career and technical education teachers. In some states, this allows educators to enter the career tech field with only an associate’s degree or a high school diploma, along with at least five years of relevant work experience. Most states require a period of student teaching or other supervised teaching experience in order to qualify for a teaching certificate, which is required in public K-12 schools. In some career tech subjects, like accounting, a master’s degree in the subject to be taught may be preferred by some schools. Earning a graduate degree can also help vocational teachers qualify for teaching positions in colleges and/or universities..</p>
